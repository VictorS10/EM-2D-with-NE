                   % If we select -1 -> It will just detect when the value goes from positive to negative
                   % Thus, we could think we should use direction(1) = -1 since the hight of the foot is positive and it
                   % is decressing, so we want to detect when be negative (i.e. it already stepped the ground). However 0
                   % is used in order to be more precise, since sometimes the change from positive to negative is "so rough".
                   % For instance, the hight of the foot could be 0.1m and then -0.1m and if direction(1) = -1 the
                   % algorithm would stop. Nevertheless we can not know what happend from 0.1m to 0m. Thus, by using
                   % direction(1) = 0, the algorithm will stop until z_foot is very small (based on the values given by
                   % "Reltol" and/or "AbsTol"). Thus, at that moment, it doesn't matter if it change from positive to
                   % negative or vice versa since the chage is so small that doesn't affect for example from
                   % z_foot = -0.00000000001 to 0.00000000001
